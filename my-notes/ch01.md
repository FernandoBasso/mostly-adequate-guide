About the perils of “our modern, assignment approach.” Hard to keep track of the mutating internal state.

State and mutable values are hard to keep track of.

Conjoin is just a addition, and breed is just multiplication.


Associative:

```
(x + y) + z === x + (y + z);

add(add(x, y), z) === add(x, add(y, z));
```

Commutative:

```
x + y === y + x;

add(x, y) === add(y, x);
```

Identity:

```
x + 0 === x;

add(x, 0) === x;
```


Distributive:

```
x * (y + z) === x * y + x * z;

multiply(x, add(y,z)) === add(multiply(x, y), multiply(x, z));
```

The book then shows this:

```js
// Original line
add(multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockC)), multiply(flockA, flockB));

// <1>
// Apply the identity property to remove the extra add
// (add(flockA, flockC) == flockA)
add(multiply(flockB, flockA), multiply(flockA, flockB));

// Apply distributive property to achieve our result
multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockA));
```

<1> Especial attention to this part. We have to remember that `flockC` is 0.


“Lawlessness is good if you're a criminal, but in this book, we'll want to acknowledge and obey the laws of math.”

Goal: express problems in terms of generic, composable bits and exploit their properties for great good! It will take a bit more discipline than the "anything goes" approach of imperative programming.
